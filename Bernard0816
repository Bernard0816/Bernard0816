# Hi there 👋, I'm Bernard  

🔐 **Cybersecurity Analyst | Threat Hunter | Vulnerability Management Specialist**  

I’m passionate about securing digital landscapes, uncovering vulnerabilities before attackers do, and turning security challenges into robust defenses.  
My expertise spans penetration testing, network analysis, and incident response — backed by hands-on use of tools like Nessus, Wireshark, and Nmap.
